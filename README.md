OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT:

The project can be selected in two options: user-computer or computer-computer.
At the beginning of the game, each player will have 5 cards consisting of 3 different types of cards: rock, paper, and scissors.
No selection can be made at the beginning of the game.

User-Computer:

In the user-computer game, the user selects their object choice at the beginning of the game, while the computer randomly selects objects.

Computer-Computer:
In the computer-computer game, all selections are made automatically.

The game ends when one of two conditions is met:
• When one side runs out of objects,
• When the total number of moves determined at the beginning is completed.

The same card cannot be selected twice before all cards are chosen. Once all 5 cards are selected, the same object can be selected again.

Objects with a level score exceeding 30 are promoted. (Rock card will turn into heavy rock card, paper card will turn into special paper card, scissors card will turn into master scissors card.)

Durability and level score properties are common for all objects used in the game.
Objects must belong to one of the 3 subclasses: rock, paper, and scissors.
Rigidity property for rocks, penetration property for papers, and sharpness property for scissors are specific properties of their own classes. Additionally, each of these 3 classes has its own subclasses. These are:
Under the rock class, there is a heavy rock subclass.
Under the paper class, there are special paper and master scissors subclasses.
In turn, temperature for heavy rock, thickness for special paper, and resistance for master scissors are specific properties for these subclasses. Below, the classes are shown relationally."

The impact scores for the objects selected by the user and the computer will be calculated according to the following formulas. The numerator in each formula represents the attacking side, while the denominator corresponds to the values of the opponent side. Variables within curly brackets should be used if they exist among the properties of that object; otherwise, they should not be considered in the calculation.
